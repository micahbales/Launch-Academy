You're still enjoying your Galapagos vacation! On the third night, you and your
family go to this cute restaurant called the IslaGrill.  After a delicious meal,
your parents ask you to write a quick Ruby program to calculate potential tips
for the waiter.  The total cost of the meal was $178.  They would like to know
how much tip to give for 20% of the bill.

You are given a 'tip' variable that contains the tip percentage in the form of
an integer.  Use this variable to calculate the proper tip. Then, print out both
the tip amount and the total.

Start with Ruby code below:

```ruby
dinner_total = 178
tip = 20
```

Sample output:

```no-highlight
You should tip $35.6
The total bill is $213.6
```
