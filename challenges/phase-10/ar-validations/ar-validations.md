Time to validate our Brussels Sprouts recipes in our blog.

### Learning Goals

* Ensure that data stored in records is of valid type
* Examine the effect that enforced datatypes has on our code

### Instructions

* Last night you created a Brussels Sprouts recipe blog. We are going to add some validations to it.
* Validate that the title of each recipe exists.
* Validate that the title of each recipe is unique.
* Validate that the title of each recipe contains "Brussels sprouts" in it.
* Validate that the length of a comment be a maximum of 140 characters long.
* Validate that a comment has a recipe.
* Add a field `servings` to your Recipe table. This field is optional, but if supplied, it must be greater than or equal to 1. Write a validation for this.
* Load up your app in irb and comfirm that your validations work.

#### Output

Copy the code that you used to check your validations to your README.md file. Don't forget to submit your code through `et`.
