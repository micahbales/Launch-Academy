# As a user
# I want to create a meetup
# So that I can gather a group of people to do an activity
#
# Acceptance Criteria:
#
# There should be a link from the meetups index page that takes you to the meetups new page. On this page there is a form to create a new meetup.
# I must be signed in, and I must supply a name, location, and description.
# If the form submission is successful, I should be brought to the meetup's show page, and I should see a message that lets me know that I have created a meetup successfully.
# If the form submission is unsuccessful, I should remain on the meetups new page, and I should see error messages explaining why the form submission was unsuccessful. The form should be pre-filled with the values that were provided when the form was submitted.
