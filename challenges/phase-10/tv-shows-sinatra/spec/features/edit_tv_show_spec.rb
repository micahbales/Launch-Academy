# As a TV fanatic
# I want to edit an existing show
# So that I can correct any foolish mistakes

# * Submitting the edit form will update a show if all validations pass.
# * The user is redirected to the details page for that show if successfully updated.
# * If the update fails any validations, re-display the form with the appropriate error messages.
