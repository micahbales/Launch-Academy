It's time to plan your first game of golf.
In order for it to be most enjoyable, you want to bring along your favorite golf friends to join you.
The problem is, you can't remember their email address. You know you have it lying around in a hash somewhere.
Oh, wait, here it is!

```ruby
golf_contacts = {
  jim: 'workerBee@example.com',
  samantha: 'golfCartRacer@example.com',
  jane: 'pro_golfer89@example.com',
  mike: 'alwaysAtTheBeach@example.com',
  olivia: 'didYouSeeWhereThatWent@example.com',
  joan: 'bestShortGameEver@example.com'
}
```

Use the `golf_contacts` hash to invite Samantha, Jane, and Olivia to your upcoming tee time via email.

Fill out the "To:" line of your email. In order to do so, you'll have to find the relevant email addresses,
and put all of the email addresses in a string separated by commas.

For an extra challenge, try completing this challenge in a single line of text, instead of breaking it up into multiple lines! How do you feel about this new version? Is it easier to read? Writing good code is always a balance between a solution with fewer lines and code that is easy for you and other developers to read, today and many days from today! Which version would you use?

Example Output:

```no-highlight
golfCartRacer@example.com,pro_golfer89@example.com,didYouSeeWhereThatWent@example.com
```
