Time to start writing some CSS! Frequent repetition and use is the best way to solidify your CSS skills.

You've been provided with an HTML file. To get started, open that up in Google Chrome. (To open a file in your browser, open a new browser page, click "File > Open", and select the HTML file you'd like to open). Now you can see the un-styled HTML page that you'll be styling! As you work, refresh this page frequently to see your changes take effect.

There's also a CSS file included with this project. Right now, there's only one style declaration written - it should turn your page background purple when loaded into the HTML. Your first job is to link up these styles to the HTML page by adding a line to the `head` section of your HTML. When your reloaded browser page turns purple, you've done it right!

Once you've gotten the stylesheet successfully loaded into the page, go ahead and delete the code that's currently inside it. Your next task is to write your own CSS that makes each page element look the proper way, as described by the text on the page. Refresh the browser page after writing each block of style to make sure your styles take effect. Make sure that all your changes go into the CSS file - the only change you make to the HTML file should be adding the line to load your stylesheet!

The skills that you will be using in this exercise include:
- Loading a stylesheet into your HTML file
- Using HTML elements as CSS selectors
- Using the `font-weight` property
- Using the `font-style` property
- Using the `font-size` property

All of these should be described in the introductory CSS article.

Your final product should look something like this:
