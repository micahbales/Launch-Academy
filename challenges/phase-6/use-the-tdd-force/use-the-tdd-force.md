Your senior mentor, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and you were on the verge on completing the most important project in the galaxy.
Unfortunately, Obi-Wan has been promoted to the Force Ghost branch of the company, and so it is all up to you to finish up the project.
However, before Obi-Wan left, he wrote the tests for the final methods needed in the project.
Using your newfound TDD skills, it is up to you to implement these methods and get the test suite passing.

## Setup
While in your `challenges` folder, run the following in the command line:

```no-highlight
et get use-the-tdd-force
cd use-the-tdd-force
bundle
rspec
```

## Tips
- Use the output of running `rspec` to determine what methods you'll have to create in your `code.rb` file.
- You can also look at the `code_spec.rb` file itself to figure out what those methods should do.
- If you get stuck on what any of the matchers do, refer to the link in the Resources section below.

May the tests be with you...
