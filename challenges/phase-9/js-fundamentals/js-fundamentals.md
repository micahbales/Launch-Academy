# Javascript Fundamentals.

We're going to space.

Soon.

**Maybe**.

See, our Javascript Rocket Engineer (Jerry, for short) was pulling some late
nights and... well, our Diagnostic Simulator doesn't really work the way we want
it to. We are under some tight deadlines and we could *really* use the help.
Think you can lend a hand?

You'll need node and `npm` installed, and you'll need to install `jasmine`. [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) is a Javascript test-runner, like rspec for
Ruby! Our Diagnostic Simulator is built on top of it.

To install node on OSX:

```
$ brew install node
```

To install node on other OSes, use the
[appropriate installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

You can run the following commands to install `jasmine`:

```
npm install -g jasmine
npm install jasmine
```

Run `node space_woops.js` to see the state Jerry left it in. It's not pretty. You'll need to edit `space_woops.js` directly to get the tests to pass - Jerry left some notes in there to help you along.

Good luck! Jerry owes you one.
